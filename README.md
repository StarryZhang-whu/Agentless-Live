# 😺 Agentless-Live: Modified Version of Agentless for SWE-Bench-Live

## Run on SWE-Bench-Live

```
./run.sh
```


## 😺 About 

**Agentless** is an *agentless* approach to automatically solve software development problems. To solve each issue, **Agentless** follows a simple three phase process: localization, repair, and patch validation.
- 🙀 **Localization**: Agentless employs a hierarchical process to first localize the fault to specific files, then to relevant classes or functions, and finally to fine-grained edit locations
- 😼 **Repair**: Agentless takes the edit locations and samples multiple candidate patches per bug in a simple diff format
- 😸 **Patch Validation**: Agentless selects the regression tests to run and generates additional reproduction test to reproduce the original error. Using the test results, Agentless re-ranks all remaining patches to selects one to submit

## 🐈 Setup

First create the environment 

```shell
conda create -n agentless python=3.11 
conda activate agentless
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
```

Then export your OpenAI API key 
```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY={key_here}
```

Now you are ready to run **Agentless** on the problems in SWE-bench!
